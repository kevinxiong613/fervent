## Fervent

• Created a Discord bot that reacts to messages based on sentiment, raising engagement in 70,000+ member servers

• Engineered and integrated a custom Naive Bayes model for message sentiment analysis, achieving 91% accuracy
across 500,000 messages while attaining inference speeds 400% faster than pre-trained models such as roBERTa

• Deployed bot on AWS ECS after containerizing with Docker and fetched reaction images via AWS S3 buckets
